People tend to confuse between a comprehensive insurance policy and a third party insurance policy when looking for car insurance. This article will help you to understand the basic difference between both these car insurance policies:




What is Comprehensive Insurance?

Comprehensive insurance is a type of insurance that offers complete coverage protection against the damages to your vehicle due to an accident or a road-mishap. Also, a Comprehensive insurance policy provides coverage against damages due to natural and man-made calamities such as flood, fire, earthquake, theft, burglary etc.

The coverage can be boosted by selecting additional covers, such as engine protector, accessories cover, medical expenses, zero depreciation cover, etc. This cover is widely popular, as it offers full-fledged coverage and it leaves the policyholder stress-free.

A comprehensive car insurance plan includes coverage for fire, theft, natural and man-made catastrophes, such as a tornado, hurricane vandalism, damage caused to your vehicle by animals, falling objects, civil disturbance, such as a riot that causes damages to your car.

Zero Depreciation
<br><br>
Age comes with its drawbacks. The same applies to your vehicle. The older it gets, the more the value of your <br>car or bike drops or ‘depreciates’.

After all, the insurer will not consider depreciation <br>during final settlement!

Engine Protection Cover
<br><br>
<br>Engine & Gearbox Protection Cover is an ‘Add on’ that offers financial protection for damages caused to <br>the engine of the vehicle. Any damage caused, from water entering the engine to leakage of the <br>lubricating oil, is covered under the policy.
<br><br>
Roadside Assistance
<br><br>
<br>How do you fancy your set of wheels breaking down on a lonely dacoit-infested road at the stroke of<br> midnight? Fear not, roadside assistance is there to rescue. All you need to do is give them a call and they’ll<br> come to the spot and repair your vehicle. If not possible, they will tow it to the nearest service <br>station. At least you’ll be dacoit-free!   
<br><br>
Consumable Cover
<br><br>
Nowadays, motor insurance companies provide a consumable cover add-on to cover the service costs of your<br> vehicle, from the new engine oil put into your vehicle right to that missing nut on your engine cover.<br> 
<br><br>
Return to Invoice Cover
<br><br>
In case of theft or damages beyond repair, return to invoice add-on gives you the benefit of getting back the<br> complete amount of your car/bike invoice value, including the cost of registering a new vehicle and its <br>road tax respectively.<br><br>
<br><br>
Tyre Protect Cover
<br><br>
Generally, tyre damage isn't covered in standard insurance unless the damage takes place during an accident. <br>That's why this tyre protect add-on gives you the benefit to safeguard and cover for your car's tyre<br> damages such as tyre bursts, bulges or cuts during all other situations possible.
